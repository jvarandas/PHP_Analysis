# PHP analysis

The main goal of the project is to identify some vulnerabilities on PHP source code, by using a pattern matching comparing the PHP
code and the patterns.txt. This file called as patterns.txt was builded based on OWSAP list of sensitive and sanitization PHP
functions.

The program is constructed to doing an analysis based on pattern matching through a CFG analysis. It have some faults.
